# Data Pipeline Practice

This project is designed to demonstrate a simple data pipeline using Python and SQLite. It includes functionality to connect to an SQLite database, perform data operations, and manage data processing tasks.

## Project Structure

```
data_pipeline_practice
├── src
│   ├── main.py          # Main entry point of the application
│   └── utils
│       └── __init__.py  # Utility functions for data processing
├── data
│   └── sample_data.db   # SQLite database with sample data
├── requirements.txt      # Python dependencies
└── README.md             # Project documentation
```

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd data_pipeline_practice
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the application, execute the following command:
```
python src/main.py
```

This will initiate the data pipeline and perform the defined operations on the SQLite database. Make sure the `sample_data.db` file is present in the `data` directory for the application to function correctly.
